# Installation

This tutorial shows how to setup an Apibara project from scratch. The goal is to
start indexing data as quickly as possible and to understand the basic structure
of a project. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a basic indexer that
streams data from Starknet.

## Installation

This tutorial starts with a fresh Typescript project. In the examples, we use
`pnpm` as the package manager, but you can use any package manager you prefer.

Let's start by creating the project. The `--language` flag specifies which language
to use to implement indexers, while the `--no-create-indexer` flag is used to
delay the creation of the indexer.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
mkdir my-indexer
cd my-indexer
pnpm dlx apibara@next init . --language="ts" --no-create-indexer
```

```
ℹ Initializing project in .
✔ Created  package.json
✔ Created  tsconfig.json
✔ Created  apibara.config.ts

✔ Project initialized successfully
```

:::

After that, you can install the dependencies.

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm install
```

## Apibara Config

Your indexers' configuration goes in the `apibara.config.ts` file. You can
leave the configuration as is for now.

```typescript [apibara.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "apibara/config";

export default defineConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {},
});
```

## API Key

The streams hosted by Apibara require an API key.

- [Sign up for a free account](https://app.apibara.com),
- Create an API key,
- Export the API key as the `DNA_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Starknet indexer

All indexers must go in the `indexers` directory and have a name that ends with `.indexer.ts` or `.indexer.js`.
The Apibara CLI will automatically detect the indexers in this directory and
make them available to the project.

You can use the `apibara add` command to add an indexer to your project. This
command does the following:

- gathers information about the chain you want to index.
- asks about your preferred storage solution.
- creates the indexer.
- adds dependencies to your `package.json`.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm apibara add
```

```
✔ Indexer ID: … strk-staking
✔ Select a chain: › Starknet
✔ Select a network: › Mainnet
✔ Select a storage: › None
✔ Updated apibara.config.ts
✔ Updated package.json
✔ Created strk-staking.indexer.ts

ℹ Before running the indexer, run pnpm run install & pnpm run prepare
```

:::

After installing dependencies, you can look at the changes to `apibara.config.ts`.
Notice the indexer's specific runtime configuration. This is a good time to update
the indexing starting block.

```typescript [apibara.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "apibara/config";

export default defineConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {
    strkStaking: {
      startingBlock: 900_000,
      streamUrl: "https://mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch",
    },
  },
});
```

Now implement the indexer. In this case, the indexer listens for all events
emitted by the STRK staking contract.

```typescript [strk-staking.indexer.ts]
import { defineIndexer } from "apibara/indexer";
import { useLogger } from "apibara/plugins";

import type { ApibaraRuntimeConfig } from "apibara/types";
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";

export default function (runtimeConfig: ApibaraRuntimeConfig) {
  const { startingBlock, streamUrl } = runtimeConfig.strkStaking;

  return defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
    streamUrl,
    finality: "accepted",
    startingBlock: BigInt(startingBlock),
    filter: {
      events: [
        {
          address:
            "0x028d709c875c0ceac3dce7065bec5328186dc89fe254527084d1689910954b0a",
        },
      ],
    },
    plugins: [],
    async transform({ block }) {
      const logger = useLogger();
      const { events, header } = block;
      logger.log(`Block number ${header?.blockNumber}`);
      for (const event of events) {
        logger.log(`Event ${event.eventIndex} tx=${event.transactionHash}`);
      }
    },
  });
}
```

Notice the following:

- The indexer file exports a single indexer.
- The `defineIndexer` function takes the stream as parameter. In this case, the
  `StarknetStream` is used. This is needed because Apibara supports multiple networks
  with different data types.
- `streamUrl` specifies where the data comes from. You can connect to streams hosted
  by us, or to self-hosted streams.
- `startingBlock` specifies from which block to start streaming.
- These two properties are read from the `runtimeConfig` object. Use the runtime configuration
  object to have multiple presets for the same indexer.
- The `filter` specifies which data to receive. You can read more about the available
  data for Starknet in the [Starknet documentation](/docs/networks/starknet/filter).
- The `transform` function is called for each block. It receives the block as parameter.
  This is where your indexer processes the data.
- The `useLogger` hook returns an indexer-specific logger.

There are more indexer options available, you can find them [in the documentation](/docs/getting-started/indexers).

## Running the indexer

During development, you will use the `apibara` CLI to build and run indexers. For convenience,
the template adds the following scripts to your `package.json`:

```json [package.json]
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "apibara dev",
    "build": "apibara build",
    "start": "apibara start"
  }
}
```

- `dev`: runs all indexers in development mode. Indexers are automatically
  reloaded and restarted when they change.
- `build`: builds the indexers for production.
- `start`: runs a _single indexer_ in production mode. Notice you must first
  build the indexers.

Before running the indexer, you must set the `DNA_TOKEN` environment variable to your DNA API key, created from the dashboard.
You can store the environment variable in a `.env` file, but make sure not to commit it to git!

Now, run the indexer in development mode. You can specify which indexer you want to run
with the `--indexers` option. When the flag is omitted, all indexers are run concurrently.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm run dev --indexers strk-staking
```

```

```

:::

## Production build

The `apibara build` command is used to build a production version of the indexer. There are two main
changes for the production build:

- No hot code reloading is available.
- Only one indexer is started. If your project has multiple indexers, it should start them independently.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm run build
```

```
> apibara-app@0.1.0 build /tmp/my-indexer
> apibara build

✔ Output directory .apibara/build cleaned
✔ Types written to .apibara/types
◐ Building 1 indexers
✔ Build succeeded!
ℹ You can start the indexers with apibara start
```

:::

Once the indexers are built, you can run them in two (equivalent) ways:

- The `apibara start` command by specifying which indexer to run with the
  `--indexer` flag. In this tutorial we are going to use this method.
- Running `.apibara/build/start.mjs` with Node. This is useful when building Docker images for your indexers.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm run start --indexer strk-staking
```

```
> apibara-app@0.1.0 start /tmp/my-indexer
> apibara start "--indexer" "strk-staking"

```

:::

## Runtime configuration & presets

Apibara provides a mechanism for indexers to load their configuration from the `apibara.config.ts` file:

- Add the configuration under the `runtimeConfig` key in `apibara.config.ts`.
- Change your indexer's module to return a function that, given the runtime configuration, returns the indexer.

You can update the configuration to define values that are configurable by your indexer. This example used
the runtime configuration to store the DNA stream URL and contract address.

```ts [apibara.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "apibara/config";

export default defineConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {
    strkStaking: {
      startingBlock: 900_000,
      streamUrl: "https://mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch",
      contractAddress:
        "0x028d709c875c0ceac3dce7065bec5328186dc89fe254527084d1689910954b0a",
    },
  },
});
```

Then update the indexer to return a function that returns the indexer. Your editor is going to show a type error
since the types of `config.streamUrl` and `config.contractAddress` are unknown, the next session is going to
explain how to solve that issue.

```ts [strk-staking.indexer.ts]
import { defineIndexer } from "apibara/indexer";
import { useLogger } from "apibara/plugins";

import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";
import { ApibaraRuntimeConfig } from "apibara/types";

export default function (runtimeConfig: ApibaraRuntimeConfig) {
  const config = runtimeConfig.strkStaking;
  const { startingBlock, streamUrl } = config;

  return defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
    streamUrl,
    startingBlock: BigInt(startingBlock),
    filter: {
      events: [
        {
          address: config.contractAddress as `0x${string}`,
        },
      ],
    },
    async transform({ block }) {
      // Unchanged.
    },
  });
}
```

### Typescript & type safety

You may have noticed that the CLI generates types in `.apibara/types` before
building the indexers (both in development and production mode).
These types contain the type definition of your runtime configuration. You can
instruct Typescript to use them by adding the following `tsconfig.json` to your
project.

```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler"
  },
  "include": ["**/*.ts", ".apibara/types"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

After restarting the Typescript language server you will have a type-safe runtime configuration
right into your indexer!

### Presets

Having a single runtime configuration is useful but not enough for real-world
indexers. The CLI provides a way to have multiple "presets" and select which
one to use at runtime. This is useful, for example, if you're deploying the
same indexers on multiple networks where only the DNA stream URL and contract
addresses change.

You can have any number of presets in the configuration and use the `--preset` flag to select which one to use.
For example, you can add a `sepolia` preset that contains the URL of the Starknet Sepolia DNA stream.
If a preset doesn't specify a key, then the value from the root configuration is used.

```ts [apibara.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "apibara/config";

export default defineConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {
    streamUrl: "https://mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch",
    contractAddress:
      "0x028d709c875c0ceac3dce7065bec5328186dc89fe254527084d1689910954b0a" as `0x${string}`,
  },
  presets: {
    sepolia: {
      runtimeConfig: {
        streamUrl: "https://sepolia.starknet.a5a.ch",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

You can then run the indexer in development mode using the `sepolia` preset.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
npm run dev -- --indexers=strk-staking --preset=sepolia
```

```
> my-indexer@1.0.0 dev
> apibara dev --indexers=strk-staking --preset=sepolia

## Storing data & persisting state across restarts

All indexers implemented in this tutorial are stateless. They don't store any
data to a database and if you restart them they will restart indexing from the
beginning.

You can refer to our storage section to learn more about writing data to a database
and persisting the indexer's state across restarts.

# Building indexers

Indexers are created using the `defineIndexer` higher-order function. This function takes a _stream definition_ and returns a function to define the indexer.

The job of an indexer is to stream and process historical data (backfilling) and then switch to real-time mode. Indexers built using our SDK are designed to handle chain-reorganizations automatically.
If, for any reason, you need to receive notifications about reorgs, you can define [a custom `message:invalidate` hook](/docs/getting-started/plugins#hooks) to handle them.

By default, the indexer is stateless (restarts from the beginning on restart) and does not provide any storage. You can add persistence and storage by using one of the provided storage plugins.

### Example

The following example shows how to create an indexer for Starknet.

```ts [starknet.indexer.ts]
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";
import { defineIndexer } from "@apibara/indexer";

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  /* ... */
});
```

## With runtime config

To configure the indexer at runtime, export a function that takes the configuration and returns the indexer's definition.

```ts
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";
import type { ApibaraRuntimeConfig } from "apibara/types";
import { defineIndexer } from "@apibara/indexer";

export default function (runtimeConfig: ApibaraRuntimeConfig) {
  return defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
    // ...
  });
}
```

## Indexer configuration

All indexers take the same configuration options.

- **`streamUrl`**<span class="arg-type">`string`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The URL of the DNA stream to connect to.</span>
- **`filter`**<span class="arg-type">`TFilter`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The filter to apply to the DNA stream. This argument is specific to the stream definition. You should refer to the [Starknet filter reference](/docs/networks/starknet/filter) for the available options.</span>
- **`finality`**<span class="arg-type">`"finalized" | "accepted" | "pending"`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">Receive data with the specified finality. Defaults to `accepted`.</span>
- **`startingCursor`**<span class="arg-type">`{ orderKey: bigint, uniqueKey?: string }`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The cursor to start the indexer from. Defaults to the genesis block. The `orderKey` represents the block number, and the `uniqueKey` represents the block hash (optional).</span>
- **`debug`**<span class="arg-type">`boolean`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">Enable debug mode. This will print debug information to the console.</span>
- **`transform`**<span class="arg-type">`({ block, cursor, endCursor, finality, context }) => Promise<void>`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The transform function called for each block received from the DNA stream.</span>
- **`factory`**<span class="arg-type">`({ block, context }) => Promise<{ filter?: TFilter }>`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The factory function used to add data filters at runtime. Useful for creating indexers for smart contracts like Uniswap V2.</span>
- **`hooks`**<span class="arg-type">`object`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The hooks to register with the indexer. Refer to the [plugins & hooks](/docs/getting-started/plugins) page for more information.</span>
- **`plugins`**<span class="arg-type">`array`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The plugins to register with the indexer. Refer to the [plugins & hooks](/docs/getting-started/plugins) page for more information.</span>

### The transform function

The `transform` function is invoked for each block received from the DNA stream. This function is where you should implement your business logic.

**Arguments**

- **`block`**<span class="arg-type">`TBlock`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The block received from the DNA stream. See the [Starknet data reference](/docs/networks/starknet/data) for more details.</span>
- **`cursor`**<span class="arg-type">`{ orderKey: bigint, uniqueKey?: string }`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The cursor of the block before the received block.</span>
- **`endCursor`**<span class="arg-type">`{ orderKey: bigint, uniqueKey?: string }`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The cursor of the current block.</span>
- **`finality`**<span class="arg-type">`"finalized" | "accepted" | "pending"`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The finality of the block.</span>
- **`context`**<span class="arg-type">`object`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The context shared between the indexer and the plugins.</span>

The following example shows a minimal indexer that streams block headers and prints them to the console.

```ts [starknet.indexer.ts]
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";
import { defineIndexer } from "@apibara/indexer";

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  streamUrl: "https://mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch",
  filter: {
    header: "always",
  },
  async transform({ block }) {
    const { header } = block;
    console.log(header);
  },
});
```

### The factory function

The `factory` function is used to add data filters at runtime. This is useful for creating indexers for smart contracts that deploy other smart contracts like Uniswap V2 and its forks.

**Arguments**

- **`block`**<span class="arg-type">`TBlock`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The block received from the DNA stream. See the [Starknet data reference](/docs/networks/starknet/data) for more details.</span>
- **`context`**<span class="arg-type">`object`</span><br/><span class="arg-description">The context shared between the indexer and the plugins.</span>

The following example shows a minimal indexer that uses the factory function to dynamically add filters for new contracts.

```ts [factory.indexer.ts]
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";
import { defineIndexer } from "@apibara/indexer";

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  streamUrl: "https://mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch",
  filter: {
    events: [
      {
        /* ... */
      },
    ],
  },
  async factory({ block }) {
    const { events } = block;
    return {
      /* ... */
    };
  },
  async transform({ block }) {
    const { header, events } = block;
    console.log(header);
    console.log(events);
  },
});
```

description: "Learn how to use plugins to extend the functionality of your indexers."

# Plugins & Hooks

Indexers are extensible through hooks and plugins. Hooks are functions that are called at specific points in the indexer's lifecycle. Plugins are components that contain reusable hooks callbacks.

## Hooks

The following hooks are available in all indexers.

 - **`run:before`**<span class="arg-type">`() => void`</span><br/>
   <span class="arg-description">Called before the indexer starts running.</span>
 - **`run:after`**<span class="arg-type">`() => void`</span><br/>
   <span class="arg-description">Called after the indexer has finished running.</span>
 - **`connect:before`**<span class="arg-type">`({ request: StreamDataRequest<TFilter>, options: StreamDataOptions }) => void`</span><br/>
   <span class="arg-description">Called before the indexer connects to the DNA stream. Can be used to change the request or stream options.</span>
 - **`connect:after`**<span class="arg-type">`({ request: StreamDataRequest<TFilter> }) => void`</span><br/>
   <span class="arg-description">Called after the indexer has connected to the DNA stream.</span>
 - **`connect:factory`**<span class="arg-type">`({ request: StreamDataRequest<TFilter>, endCursor: { orderKey: bigint, uniqueKey?: string } }) => void`</span><br/>
   <span class="arg-description">Called before the indexer reconnects to the DNA stream with a new filter (in factory mode).</span>
 - **`message`**<span class="arg-type">`({ message: StreamDataResponse<TBlock> }) => void`</span><br/>
   <span class="arg-description">Called for each message received from the DNA stream. Additionally, message-specific hooks are available: `message:invalidate`, `message:finalize`, `message:heartbeat`, `message:systemMessage`.</span>
 - **`handler:middleware`**<span class="arg-type">`({ use: MiddlewareFunction) => void }) => void`</span><br/>
   <span class="arg-description">Called to register indexer's middlewares.</span>

## Using plugins

You can register plugins in the indexer's configuration, under the `plugins` key.

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";
import { defineIndexer } from "@apibara/indexer";

import { myAwesomePlugin } from "@/lib/my-plugin.ts";

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  streamUrl: "https://mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch",
  filter: { /* ... */ },
  plugins: [myAwesomePlugin()],
  async transform({ block: { header, validators } }) {
    /* ... */
  },
});
```

## Building plugins

Developers can create new plugins to be shared across multiple indexers or projects. Plugins use the available hooks to extend the functionality of indexers.

The main way to define a plugin is by using the `defineIndexerPlugin` function. This function takes a callback with the indexer as parameter, the plugin should register itself with the indexer's hooks.
When the runner runs the indexer, all the relevant hooks are called.

```ts [my-plugin.ts]
import type { Cursor } from "@apibara/protocol";
import { defineIndexerPlugin } from "@apibara/indexer/plugins";

export function myAwesomePlugin<TFilter, TBlock, TTxnParams>() {
  return defineIndexerPlugin<TFilter, TBlock, TTxnParams>((indexer) => {
    indexer.hooks.hook("connect:before", ({ request, options }) => {
      // Do something before the indexer connects to the DNA stream.
    });

    indexer.hooks.hook("run:after", () => {
      // Do something after the indexer has finished running.
    });
  });
}
```

## Middleware

Apibara indexers support wrapping the `transform` function in middleware. This is used, for example, to wrap all database operations in a transaction.

The middleware is registered using the `handler:middleware` hook. This hook takes a `use` argument to register the middleware with the indexer.
The argument to `use` is a function that takes the indexer's context and a `next` function to call the next middleware or the transform function.

```ts [my-plugin.ts]
import type { Cursor } from "@apibara/protocol";
import { defineIndexerPlugin } from "@apibara/indexer/plugins";

export function myAwesomePlugin<TFilter, TBlock, TTxnParams>() {
  return defineIndexerPlugin<TFilter, TBlock, TTxnParams>((indexer) => {
    const db = openDatabase();
    indexer.hooks.hook("handler:middleware", ({ use }) => {
      use(async (context, next) => {
        // Start a transaction.
        await db.transaction(async (txn) => {
          // Add the transaction to the context.
          context.db = txn;
          try {
            // Call the next middleware or the transform function.
            await next();
          } finally {
            // Remove the transaction from the context.
            context.db = undefined;
          }
        });
      });
    });
  });
}
```

## Inline hooks

For all cases where you want to use a hook without creating a plugin, you can use the `hooks` property of the indexer.

IMPORTANT: inline hooks are the recommended way to add hooks to an indexer. If the same hook is needed in multiple indexers, it is better to create a plugin. Usually, plugins lives in the `lib` folder, for example `lib/my-plugin.ts`.

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";
import { defineIndexer } from "@apibara/indexer";

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  streamUrl: "https://mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch",
  filter: { /* ... */ },
  async transform({ block: { header, events } }) {
    /* ... */
  },
  hooks: {
    async "connect:before"({ request, options }) {
      // Do something before the indexer connects to the DNA stream.
    },
  },
});
```

## Indexer lifecycle

The following Javascript pseudocode shows the indexer's lifecycle. This should give you a good understanding of when hooks are called.

```js
function run(indexer) {
  indexer.callHook("run:before");

  const { use, middleware } = registerMiddleware(indexer);

  indexer.callHook("handler:middleware", { use });

  // Create the request based on the indexer's configuration.
  const request = Request.create({
    filter: indexer.filter,
    startingCursor: indexer.startingCursor,
    finality: indexer.finality,
  });

  // Stream options.
  const options = {};

  indexer.callHook("connect:before", { request, options });

  let stream = indexer.streamData(request, options);

  indexer.callHook("connect:after");

  while (true) {
    const { message, done } = stream.next();

    if (done) {
      break;
    }

    indexer.callHook("message", { message });

    switch (message._tag) {
      case "data": {
        const { block, endCursor, finality } = message.data
        middleware(() => {
          if (indexer.isFactoryMode()) {
            // Handle the factory portion of the indexer data.
            // Implementation detail is not important here.
            const newFilter = indexer.factory();
            const request = Request.create(/* ... */);
  
            indexer.callHook("connect:factory", { request, endCursor });
            stream = indexer.streamData(request, options);
          }
  
          indexer.transform({ block, endCursor, finality });
        });
        break;
      }
      case "invalidate": {
        indexer.callHook("message:invalidate", { message });
        break;
      }
      case "finalize": {
        indexer.callHook("message:finalize", { message });
        break;
      }
      case "heartbeat": {
        indexer.callHook("message:heartbeat", { message });
        break;
      }
      case "systemMessage": {
        indexer.callHook("message:systemMessage", { message });
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  indexer.callHook("run:after");
}
```

# apibara.config.ts

The `apibara.config.ts` file is where you configure your project. If the project is using Javascript, the file is named `apibara.config.js`.

## General

**`runtimeConfig: R extends Record<string, unknown>`**

The `runtimeConfig` contains the runtime configuration passed to indexers [if they accept it](/docs/getting-started/indexers#with-runtime-config).
Use this to configure chain or environment specific options such as starting block and contract address.

```ts [apibara.config.ts]
export default defineConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {
    connectionString: process.env["POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING"] ?? "memory://",
  },
});
```

**`presets: Record<string, R>`**

Presets represent different configurations of `runtimeConfig`. You can use presets to switch between different environments, like development, test, and production.

```ts [apibara.config.ts]
export default defineConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {
    connectionString: process.env["POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING"] ?? "memory://",
  },
  presets: {
    dev: {
      connectionString: "memory://",
    },
  },
});
```

**`preset: string`**

The default preset to use.

**`rootDir: string`**

Change the project's root directory.

**`buildDir: string`**

The directory used for building the indexers. Defaults to `.apibara`.

**`outputDir: string`**

The directory where to output the built indexers. Defaults to `.apibara/build`.

**`indexersDir: string`**

The directory where to look for `*.indexer.ts` or `.indexer.js` files. Defaults to `indexers`.

**`hooks`**

Project level [hooks](/docs/getting-started/plugins).

**`debug: boolean`**

Enable debug mode, printing more detailed logs.

## Build config

**`rolldownConfig: RolldownConfig`**

Override any field in the [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/) configuration.

**`exportConditions?: string[]`**

Shorthand for `rolldownConfig.resolve.exportConditions`.

## File watcher

**`watchOptions: WatchOptions`**

Configure Rolldown's file watcher. Defaults to `{ignore: ["**/node_modules/**", "**/.apibara/**"]}`.

# instrumentation.ts

It's easy to add observability to your indexer using our native instrumentation powered by [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).

## Convention

To add instrumentation to your project, create a `instrumentation.ts` file at the root (next to `apibara.config.ts`).

This file should export a `register` function, this function is called _once_ by the runtime before the production indexer is started.

```ts [instrumentation.ts]
import type { RegisterFn } from "apibara/types";

export const register: RegisterFn = async () => {
  // Setup OpenTelemetry SDK exporter
};
```

### Logger

You can also replace the default logger by exporting a `logger` function from `instrumentation.ts`. This function should return a `console`-like object with the same methods as `console`.

```ts [instrumentation.ts]
import type { LoggerFactoryFn } from "apibara/types";

export const logger: LoggerFactoryFn = ({ indexer, indexers, preset }) => {
  // Build console here.
};
```

## Examples

### OpenTelemetry with OpenTelemetry Collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation for receiving, processing, and exporting telemetry data. Using the collector with Apibara allows you to collect and send both metrics and traces to your preferred observability backend.

#### 1. Install required dependencies

First, install the required OpenTelemetry packages:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm install @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node @opentelemetry/exporter-metrics-otlp-grpc @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/sdk-metrics @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions
```

#### 2. Update instrumentation.ts to use the OpenTelemetry Collector

Create or update the `instrumentation.ts` file at the root of your project:

```ts [instrumentation.ts]
import { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } from "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node";
import { OTLPMetricExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-metrics-otlp-grpc";
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc";
import {
  defaultResource,
  resourceFromAttributes,
} from "@opentelemetry/resources";
import { PeriodicExportingMetricReader } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics";
import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { SimpleSpanProcessor } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node";
import {
  ATTR_SERVICE_NAME,
  ATTR_SERVICE_VERSION,
} from "@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions";
import type { RegisterFn } from "apibara/types";

export const register: RegisterFn = async () => {
  // Create a resource that identifies your service
  const resource = defaultResource().merge(
    resourceFromAttributes({
      [ATTR_SERVICE_NAME]: "apibara",
      [ATTR_SERVICE_VERSION]: "1.0.0",
    })
  );
  const collectorOptions = {
    // configure the grpc endpoint of the opentelemetry-collector
    url: "http://localhost:4317",
  };

  // Configure the OTLP exporter for metrics using grpc protocol,
  const metricExporter = new OTLPMetricExporter(collectorOptions);
  const metricReader = new PeriodicExportingMetricReader({
    exporter: metricExporter,
    exportIntervalMillis: 1000,
  });

  // Configure the OTLP exporter for traces using grpc protocol,
  const traceExporter = new OTLPTraceExporter(collectorOptions);
  const spanProcessors = [new SimpleSpanProcessor(traceExporter)];

  // Configure the SDK
  const sdk = new NodeSDK({
    resource,
    spanProcessors,
    metricReader,
    instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
  });

  // Start the SDK
  sdk.start();
};
```

#### 3. Build and run your indexer to see the metrics and traces on the configured OpenTelemetry Collector.

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm build
pnpm start --indexer=your-indexer
```

The following metrics are available out of the box:

- `current_block`: The latest block number being processed by the indexer
- `processed_blocks_total`: Total number of blocks that have been processed
- `reorgs_total`: Number of chain reorganizations detected and handled

Additionally, you can observe detailed traces showing:

- Block processing lifecycle and duration
- Individual transform function execution time
- Chain reorganization handling

### Prometheus

Collecting metrics with Prometheus and visualizing them is a powerful way to monitor your indexers. This section shows how to set up OpenTelemetry with Prometheus.

#### 1. Install required dependencies

First, install the required OpenTelemetry packages:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm install @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node @opentelemetry/exporter-prometheus @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions
```

#### 2. Update instrumentation.ts to use the OpenTelemetry SDK

Update the `instrumentation.ts` file at the root of your project:

```ts [instrumentation.ts]
import { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } from "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node";
import { PrometheusExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-prometheus";
import {
  defaultResource,
  resourceFromAttributes,
} from "@opentelemetry/resources";
import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import {
  ATTR_SERVICE_NAME,
  ATTR_SERVICE_VERSION,
} from "@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions";
import type { RegisterFn } from "apibara/types";

export const register: RegisterFn = async () => {
  // Create a resource that identifies your service
  const resource = defaultResource().merge(
    resourceFromAttributes({
      [ATTR_SERVICE_NAME]: "apibara",
      [ATTR_SERVICE_VERSION]: "1.0.0",
    })
  );

  // By default port 9464 will be exposed on the apibara app
  const prometheusExporter = new PrometheusExporter();

  // Configure the SDK
  const sdk = new NodeSDK({
    resource,
    metricReader: prometheusExporter,
    instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
  });

  sdk.start();
};
```

#### 3. Build and run your indexer to see the metrics and traces on your configured observability platform.

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm build
pnpm start --indexer=your-indexer
```

### Sentry

#### 1. Install required dependencies

First, install the required Sentry package:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm install @sentry/node
```

#### 2. Update instrumentation.ts to use Sentry

Update the `instrumentation.ts` file at the root of your project:

```ts [instrumentation.ts]
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";
import type { RegisterFn } from "apibara/types";

export const register: RegisterFn = async () => {
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: "__YOUR_DSN__",
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  });
};
```

#### 3. Build and run your indexer with Sentry error tracking enabled

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm build
pnpm start --indexer=your-indexer
```

The Sentry SDK uses OpenTelemetry under the hood, which means any OpenTelemetry instrumentation that emits spans will automatically be picked up by Sentry without additional configuration.

For more information on how to use Sentry with OpenTelemetry, refer to the [Sentry documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/node/opentelemetry/).

# Top tips

Find most useful tips and patterns to help you get the most out of Apibara.

## General

### Watching a file

You can watch files for changes during indexer execution, which is useful for development workflows and dynamic configuration updates. Here's an example of how to implement file watching using Node.js's built-in `fs.watch`:

```ts [watchfile.indexer.ts]
import { watch } from "node:fs";
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";
import { defineIndexer, reloadIndexer } from "apibara/indexer";
import { useLogger } from "apibara/plugins";
import type { ApibaraRuntimeConfig } from "apibara/types";

export default function (runtimeConfig: ApibaraRuntimeConfig) {
  return defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
    streamUrl: "https://mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch",
    finality: "accepted",
    startingBlock: 10_000n,
    filter: {
      // ...
    },
    hooks: {
      "run:before": ({ abortSignal }) => {
        const logger = useLogger();
        logger.info("=== FILE WATCHER SET UP ===");

        watch("./tmp/test", { signal: abortSignal }, () => {
          logger.info("=== FILE CHANGED ===");
          reloadIndexer();
        });
      },
    },
    async transform({ endCursor, finality }) {
      // ...
    },
  });
}
```

**⚠️ Important warnings:**

- **Use `watch` instead of `watchFile`**: When watching files, use `fs.watch()` instead of `fs.watchFile()`. The `watch` function works fine with `reloadIndexer()` or `useIndexerContext()`, but `watchFile` has compatibility issues with `AsyncLocalStorage` from `node:async_hooks` which is used internally by Apibara.

- **If you must use `watchFile`**, make sure to call `fs.unwatchFile()` before setting up a new callback to prevent callback accumulation during indexer reloads and ensure latest context is used.

- **Multiple triggers per file change**: Watch callbacks may be triggered multiple times for a single file change due to OS-level differences. Different operating systems handle file system events differently, so your callback might fire 2-3 times for one modification.

**💡 Best practices:**

- Use the `abortSignal` parameter from hooks to properly clean up watchers when the indexer stops or reloads. This prevents orphaned watchers and ensures clean shutdown.
- The abort signal is automatically triggered when the indexer is stopped or killed, making it perfect for cleanup scenarios during indexer reloads.

### Reloading the indexer

You can programmatically reload your indexer using the `reloadIndexer()` function:

```ts [watchfile.indexer.ts]
import { watch } from "node:fs";
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";
import { defineIndexer, reloadIndexer } from "apibara/indexer";
import { useLogger } from "apibara/plugins";
import type { ApibaraRuntimeConfig } from "apibara/types";

export default function (runtimeConfig: ApibaraRuntimeConfig) {
  return defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
    streamUrl: "https://mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch",
    finality: "accepted",
    startingBlock: 10_000n,
    filter: {
      // ...
    },
    async transform({ endCursor, finality }) {
      // ...
      if (endCursor?.orderKey === 150000n) {
        reloadIndexer();
      }
    },
  });
}
```

title: Upgrading from v1
description: "Learn how to upgrade your indexers to Apibara v2."
diataxis: how-to
updatedAt: 2025-06-11

# Upgrading from v1

This guide explains how to upgrade your Starknet indexers from the old Apibara
CLI experience to the new Apibara v2 experience.

At the time of writing (June 2025), Apibara v2 is the recommended version for
new and existing applications.

## Main changes

- The underlying gRPC protocol and data types have changed. You can review all
  the changes [on this page](/docs/networks/starknet/upgrade-from-v1).
- The old CLI has been replaced by a pure Typescript library. This means you
  can now leverage the full Node ecosystem (including Bun and Deno).
- You can now extend indexers with [plugins and hooks](/docs/getting-started/plugins).

## Migration

For this guide, we'll assume an indexer like the following:

```ts [indexer.ts]
export const config = {
  streamUrl: "https://mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch",
  startingBlock: 800_000,
  network: "starknet",
  finality: "DATA_STATUS_ACCEPTED",
  filter: {
    header: {},
  },
  sinkType: "console",
  sinkOptions: {},
};

export default function transform(block) {
  return block;
}
```

### Step 1: initialize the Node project

Initialize the project to contain a `package.json` file:

```bash [Terminal]
npm init -y
```

Create the `indexers/` folder where all the indexers will live:

```bash [Terminal]
mkdir indexers
```

Add the dependencies needed to run the indexer. If you're using any external
dependencies, make sure to add them.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
npm add --save apibara@next @apibara/protocol@next @apibara/starknet@next
```

```
added 325 packages, and audited 327 packages in 11s

73 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

:::

### Step 2: initialize the Apibara project

Create a new file called `apibara.config.ts` in the root of your project.

```ts [apibara.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "apibara/config";

export default defineConfig({});
```

### Step 3: update the indexer

Now it's time to update the indexer.

- Move the indexer to the `indexers/` folder, ensuring that the file name ends
  with `.indexer.ts`.
- Wrap the indexer in a `defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({ /* ... */ })` call.
  Notice that now the stream configuration and transform function live in the same
  configuration object.
- `startingBlock` is now a `BigInt`.
- `streamUrl` is the same.
- `finality` is now simpler to type.
- The `filter` object changed. Please refer to the [filter documentation](/docs/networks/starknet/filter) for more information.
- `sinkType` and `sinkOptions` are gone.
- The `transform` function now takes named arguments, with `block` containing the block data.

The following `git diff` shows the changes to the indexer at the beginning of the guide.

```diff

+        const logger = useLogger();
+        logger.info(block);
+    },
+});
\ No newline at end of file
```

### Step 4: writing data

In version 1, the indexer would write data returned by `transform` to a sink.
Now, you use plugins to write data to databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

Refer to the plugins documentation for more information.

## Sink-specific instructions

### Webhook

Depending on your use-case, you have two strategies to update your existing webhook sink script to v2:

 - Call the external webhook using the `fetch` API.
 - Inline the webhook script in your indexer.

In the first case, transform the block's data like in V1 and then call the `fetch` method.

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
import { defineIndexer } from "apibara/indexer";
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";

import { transformBlock } from "../lib/helpers";

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  streamUrl,
  finality: "accepted",
  startingBlock: 1_000_000n,
  filter: {
    events: [
      {
        address:
          "0x028d709c875c0ceac3dce7065bec5328186dc89fe254527084d1689910954b0a",
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [],
  async transform({ block }) {
    const payload = transformBlock(block);

    // Make an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL
    const response = await fetch("https://example.org/webhook", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(payload),
    });

    // Handle the response if needed.
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Response status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const result = await response.json();
  },
});
```

If you were using the "raw" mode for the webhook sink script, you also need to register a hook to call the webhook URL on invalidate messages.

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
import { defineIndexer } from "apibara/indexer";
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  /* same as before */
  async transform({ block }) {
    /* ... */
  },
  hooks: {
    async "message:invalidate"({ message }) {
      const { cursor } = message;
      const response = await fetch("https://example.org/webhook", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          // orderKey is a BigInt, so convert it to a string to safely send it to the webhook
          invalidate: {
            orderKey: String(cursor.orderKey),
            uniqueKey: cursor.uniqueKey,
          }
        }),
      });

      // Handle the response if needed.
    },
  },
});
```

Some users found that they can implement the webhook script inline in their indexer.
This results in a more efficient indexer that is easier to maintain and deploy.

Please refer to the [installation and getting started](/docs/getting-started/installation) page for more information.

title: Drizzle with PostgreSQL
description: "Store your indexer's data to PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM."
diataxis: reference
updatedAt: 2025-05-01

# Drizzle with PostgreSQL

The Apibara Indexer SDK supports Drizzle ORM for storing data to PostgreSQL.

## Installation

### Using the CLI

You can add an indexer that uses Drizzle for storage by selecting "PostgreSQL"
in the "Storage" section when creating an indexer.

The CLI automatically updates your `package.json` to add all necessary dependencies.

### Manually

To use Drizzle with PostgreSQL, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash [Terminal]
npm install drizzle-orm pg @apibara/plugin-drizzle@next
```

We recommend using Drizzle Kit to manage the database schema.

```bash [Terminal]
npm install --save-dev drizzle-kit
```

Additionally, if you want to use PGLite to run a Postgres compatible database without a full Postgres installation, you should install that package too.

```bash [Terminal]
npm install @electric-sql/pglite
```

## Persisting the indexer's state

The Drizzle plugin automatically persists the indexer's state to the database.
You can explicitly configure this option with the `persistState` flag.

## Adding the plugin to your indexer

Add the `drizzleStorage` plugin to your indexer's `plugins`. Notice the following:

- Use the `drizzle` helper exported by `@apibara/plugin-drizzle` to create a
  drizzle instance. This method supports creating an in-memory database (powered by PgLite)
  by specifying the `memory:` connection string.
- Always specify the database schema. This schema is used by the indexer to know which tables
  it needs to protect against chain reorganizations.
- By default, the connection string is read from the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable. If left empty, a local PGLite database will be created. This is great because it means you don't need to start Postgres on your machine to develop locally!

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
import {
  drizzle,
  drizzleStorage,
  useDrizzleStorage,
} from "@apibara/plugin-drizzle";

import { transfers } from "@/lib/schema";

const db = drizzle({
  schema: {
    transfers,
  },
});

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  // ...
  plugins: [drizzleStorage({ db })],
  // ...
});
```

## Schema configuration

You can use the `pgTable` function from `drizzle-orm/pg-core` to define the schema,
no changes required.

The only important thing to notice is that your table **must have an `id` column (name configurable)**
that uniquely identifies each row. This requirement is necessary to handle chain reorganizations.
Read more how the plugin handles chain reorganizations [on the internals page](/docs/storage/drizzle-pg/internals).

```ts [lib/schema.ts]
import { bigint, pgTable, text, uuid } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const transfers = pgTable("transfers", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  amount: bigint("amount", { mode: "number" }),
  transactionHash: text("transaction_hash"),
});
```

## Specifying the id column

As mentioned in the previous section, the id column is required by the plugin to handle chain reorganizations.

The plugin allows you to specify the id column name for each table in the schema. You can do this by passing the `idColumn` option to the `drizzleStorage` plugin. This option accepts either a string value or a record mapping table names to column names. You can use the special `"*"` table name to define the default id column name for all tables.

### Example

This example uses the same id column name (`_id`) for all tables.

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    drizzleStorage({
      db,
      idColumn: "_id",
    }),
  ],
  // ...
});
```

This example uses different id column names for each table. The `transfers` table will use `transfer_id` as the id column, while all other tables will use `_id`.

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    drizzleStorage({
      db,
      idColumn: {
        transfers: "transfer_id",
        "*": "_id",
      },
    }),
  ],
  // ...
});
```

## Writing and reading data from within the indexer

Use the `useDrizzleStorage` hook to access the current database transaction.
This transaction behaves exactly like a regular Drizzle ORM transaction because
it is. Thanks to the way the plugin works and handles chain reorganizations, it
can expose the full Drizzle ORM API without any limitations.

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  // ...
  async transform({ endCursor, block, context, finality }) {
    const { db } = useDrizzleStorage();

    for (const event of block.events) {
      await db.insert(transfers).values(decodeEvent(event));
    }
  },
});
```

You are not limited to inserting data, you can also update and delete rows.

### Drizzle query

Using the [Drizzle Query interface](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/rqb) is easy.
Pass the database instance to `useDrizzleStorage`: in this case the database type
is used to automatically deduce the database schema.

**Note**: the database instance is _not_ used to query data but only for type inference.

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
const database = drizzle({ schema, connectionString });

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  // ...
  async transform({ endCursor, block, context, finality }) {
    const { db } = useDrizzleStorage(database);

    const existingToken = await db.query.tokens.findFirst({ address });
  },
});
```

## Querying data from outside the indexer

You can query data from your application like you always do, using the standard Drizzle ORM library.

## Database migrations

There are two strategies you can adopt for database migrations:

- run migrations separately, for example using the drizzle-kit CLI.
- run migrations automatically upon starting the indexer.

If you decide to adopt the latter strategy, use the `migrate` option. Notice that the `migrationsFolder` path is relative from the project's root.

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
import { drizzle } from "@apibara/plugin-drizzle";

const database = drizzle({ schema });

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    drizzleStorage({
      db,
      migrate: {
        // Path relative to the project's root.
        migrationsFolder: "./migrations",
      },
    }),
  ],
  // ...
});
```

# Testing

The Drizzle plugin provides an in-memory database to simplify testing, powered by [PGLite](https://pglite.dev/).

## Indexer setup

Register the Drizzle plugin with your indexer. The default configuration automatically creates a PGLite database when running tests.

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
import { drizzleStorage, useDrizzleStorage } from "@apibara/plugin-drizzle";
import { drizzle } from "@apibara/plugin-drizzle";
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";
import { defineIndexer } from "apibara/indexer";

import { myTable } from "@/lib/schema";

export default function (runtimeConfig: ApibaraRuntimeConfig) {
  const database = drizzle({
    schema: {
      myTable,
    },
  });

  return defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
    plugins: [
      drizzleStorage({
        db: database,
      }),
    ],
    async transform({ endCursor, block, context, finality }) {
      const { db } = useDrizzleStorage();

      // Do something with the database
    },
  });
}
```

## Testing

The `@apibara/plugin-drizzle` package provides two helper functions to work with test databases:

 - `useTestDrizzleStorage`: get the Drizzle database object internally created by the plugin.
 - `getTestDatabase`: call it with the value returned by the vcr to get the Drizzle database after running the test.

If you need to initialize data in the database, you can add a hook to `run:before` and initialize the database there.

## Example

The following example shows a complete end-te-end test for the indexer.

 - Pass a custom runtime configuration to the indexer's constructor.
 - Initialize the database before running the indexer.
 - Read the data from the database and assert its content with [vitest snapshot matching](https://vitest.dev/guide/snapshot).

```ts [test/my-indexer.test.ts]
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";
import { createVcr } from "apibara/testing";
import { useTestDrizzleStorage } from "@apibara/plugin-drizzle";
import { getTestDatabase } from "@apibara/plugin-drizzle/testing";

// Import the indexer's constructor
import createIndexer from "@/indexers/my-indexer.indexer";

const vcr = createVcr();

describe("my indexer", () => {
  it("should work", async () => {
    const indexer = createIndexer({
      /* runtime configuration */
    });

    const testResult = await vcr.run("starknet-strk-transfers", indexer, {
      range: {
        fromBlock: 10_000_000n,
        toBlock: 10_000_005n,
      },
      hooks: {
        "run:before": async () => {
          // Initialize the database
          const db = useTestDrizzleStorage();
          await db.insert(myTable).values({ /* ... */});

        },
      },
    });

    // Get the database created for this test.
    const database = getTestDatabase(testResult);

    // Use the database like any other Drizzle database object
    const rows = await database.select().from(myTable);

    expect(rows.map(({ _id, ...rest }) => rest)).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
      /* ... */
    `);
  });
});
```

# Drizzle's plugin internals

This section describes how the Drizzle plugin works. Understanding the content of this page is not needed for using the plugin.

## Drizzle and the indexer

The plugin wraps all database operations in the `transform` and `factory` functions in a database transaction.
This ensures that the indexer's state is always consistent and that data is never lost due to crashes or network failures.

More specifically, the plugin is implemented as a [middleware](/docs/getting-started/plugins#middleware).

At a very high level, the plugin looks like the following:

```ts
indexer.hooks.hook("handler:middleware", async ({ use }) => {
  use(async (context, next) => {
    await db.transaction(async (txn) => {
      // Assign the transaction to the context, to be accessed using useDrizzleStorage
      context.db = txn;

      await next();

      delete context.db;

      // Update the indexer's state with cursor.
      await updateState(txn);
    });
  });
});
```

## Chain reorganizations

The indexer needs to be able to rollback state after a chain reorganization.
The behavior described in this section is only relevant for un-finalized blocks.
Finalized blocks don't need special handling since they are, by definition, not going to
be part of a chain reorganization.

The main idea is to create an ["audit table"](https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-audit) with
all changes to the indexer's schema.

The name of the audit table is `airfoil.reorg_rollback` and has the following schema.

```txt
+------------+--------------+-----------------------+
| Column     | Type         | Modifiers             |
|------------+--------------+-----------------------|
| n          | integer      |  not null default ... |
| op         | character(1) |  not null             |
| table_name | text         |  not null             |
| cursor     | integer      |  not null             |
| row_id     | text         |                       |
| row_value  | jsonb        |                       |
| indexer_id | text         |  not null             |
+------------+--------------+-----------------------+
```

The data stored in the `row_value` column is specific to each operation (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE) contains the data needed to revert the operation. Notice that the table's row must be JSON-serializable.

At each block, the plugin registers a trigger for each table managed by the indexer. At the end of the transaction, the trigger inserts data into the audit table.

The audit table is periodically pruned to remove snapshots of data that is now finalized.

### Reverting a block

When a chain reorganization is detected, all operations in the audit table where `cursor` is greater than the new chain's head are reverted in reverse order.

- `op = INSERT`: the row with id `row_id` is deleted from the table.
- `op = DELETE`: the row with id `row_id` is inserted back into the table, with the value stored in `row_value`.
- `op = UPDATE`: the row with id `row_id` is updated in the table, with the value stored in `row_value`.

## State persistence

The state of the indexer is persisted in the database, in the `airfoil.checkpoints` and `airfoil.filters` tables.

The checkpoints table contains the last indexed block for each indexer.

```txt
+------------+--------------+-----------------------+
| Column     | Type         | Modifiers             |
|------------+--------------+-----------------------|
| id         | text         |  primary key          |
| order_key  | integer      |  not null             |
| unique_key | text         |                       |
+------------+--------------+-----------------------+
```

The filters table is used to manage the dynamic filter of factory indexers. It contains the JSON-serialized filter together with the block range it applies to.

```txt
+------------+--------------+-----------------------+
| Column     | Type         | Modifiers             |
|------------+--------------+-----------------------|
| id         | text         |  not null             |
| filter     | text         |  not null             |
| from_block | integer      |  not null             |
| to_block   | integer      |  default null         |
+------------+--------------+-----------------------+
```

# Drizzle's plugin API reference

## drizzle

This helper is used to create a Drizzle database that integrates with the Apibara indexer and cli.

```ts
import { drizzle } from "@apibara/plugin-drizzle";

// Here `transfers` and `balances` are standard Drizzle tables.
const database = drizzle({
  schema: {
    transfers,
    balances,
  }
});
```

### Arguments

**schema: TSchema**

A standard Drizzle schema, that is a map of tables.

**connectionString: string**

The connection string. By default, the helper uses the value of the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable.
If the connection string is `memory://`, the indexer will run with an in-memory PgLite database.

## drizzleStorage

This function is used to create the Drizzle's plugin. This is how you configure its behaviour.

```ts
import { drizzleStorage } from "@apibara/plugin-drizzle";

export default defineIndexer(...)({
  plugins: [
    drizzleStorage({
      db: database,
      migrate: {
        migrationsFolder: "./drizzle",
      },
    }),
  ]
})
```

### Arguments

**db: PgDatabase**

The Drizzle database instance.

**persistState: boolean**

Whether to persist the indexer's state. Defaults to `true`.

**indexerName: string**

The name of the indexer. The default is the filename of the indexer.

**schema: TSchema**

The Drizzle schema containing the tables used by indexers.

**idColumn: string | IdColumnMap**

The column to use as the row id. Defaults to `id`.

If your tables use different names for the id columns, you can pass a record to this argument. For example, the following snippets uses the `address` column for the `balances` table, and `id` for all other tables (specified using the special `*` name):

```ts
drizzleStorage({
  idColumn: {
    "balances": "address",
    "*": "id"
  }
})
```

**migrate: MigrateConfig**

The options for the database migration. When provided, the database will automatically run migrations before the indexer runs.

**recordChainReorganizations: boolean**

Whether to record chain reorganizations in the database. Defaults to `false`.

## useDrizzleStorage

This hook returns the current Postgres transaction and is the only way to access the database from within the indexer.

```ts
import { useDrizzleStorage } from "@apibara/plugin-drizzle";

export default defineIndexer(...)({
  async transform({ ... }) {
    const { db } = useDrizzleStorage();

    await db.insert(...);
  }
})
```

# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### Argument of type `PgTableWithColumns` is not assignable to parameter of type `PgTable`.

When structuring your project as monorepo, you may encounter the following error when type checking your project.

```txt
indexers/my-indexer.indexer.ts:172:25 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'PgTableWithColumns<{ name: "my_table"; schema: undefined; columns: { ... }; dialect:...' is not assignable to parameter of type 'PgTable<TableConfig>'.
  The types of '_.config.columns' are incompatible between these types.
    Type '{ ... }' is not assignable to type 'Record<string, PgColumn<ColumnBaseConfig<ColumnDataType, string>, {}, {}>>'.
      Property 'myColumn' is incompatible with index signature.
        Type 'PgColumn<{ name: "my_column"; tableName: "my_table"; dataType: "number"; columnType: "PgBigInt53"; data: number; driverParam: string | number; notNull: false; hasDefault: false; isPrimaryKey: false; ... 5 more ...; generated: undefined; }, {}, {}>' is not assignable to type 'PgColumn<ColumnBaseConfig<ColumnDataType, string>, {}, {}>'.
          The types of 'table._.config.columns' are incompatible between these types.

                  Property 'config' is protected but type 'Column<T, TRuntimeConfig, TTypeConfig>' is not a class derived from 'Column<T, TRuntimeConfig, TTypeConfig>'.

            await db.insert(myTable).values(rows);
```

This error is caused by different versions of `drizzle-orm`, `pg`, and `@types/pg` being used in different packages in your project.
The solution is to make sure all of them use the same version, delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall your dependencies.

###  Cancelling statement due to statement timeout

When running the indexer, it hangs due to a statement timeout. The error looks like this:

```txt

    at async withTransaction (.apibara/build/start.mjs:47631:9)

[error] Failed to run handler:middleware
```

This happens because internally the Drizzle plugin creates a transaction for each block to ensure data consistency.
This means you cannot use the root Drizzle database object directly because it will hang indefinitely while waiting for the transaction to complete.

**Solution**: Use the database object returned by the `useDrizzleStorage()` hook. This is the current database transaction.

```ts
import { useDrizzleStorage } from "@apibara/plugin-drizzle";

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  // ...
  async transform({ endCursor, block, context, finality }) {
    // Use this database object.
    // This object provides all the methods available in the root Drizzle
    // database object, but it's a transaction-specific database object.
    const { db } = useDrizzleStorage();
  },
});
````

## Performance

### Why is indexing slower after I add the plugin?

There are many possible reasons for this, but the most common ones are:

- The latency between your indexer and the database is high.
- Your indexer is inserting rows too frequently.

In the first case, consider moving your indexer's deployment closer to the database to improve latency.

In the second case, consider using a bulk insert strategy to reduce the number of individual insert operations.
Usually, this means converting many `db.insert(..)` operations inside a loop into a single `db.insert()` call.

```ts
// Before
for (const event of block.events) {
  const transfer = decodeEvent(event);
  await db.insert(schema.transfers).values(transfer);
}

// After
const transfers = block.events.map((event) => decodeEvent(event));
await db.insert(schema.transfers).values(transfers);
```

Apibara represents Starknet field elements as hex-encode strings.

```ts
export type FieldElement = `0x${string}`;
```

## Filter types

### Root

The root filter object contains a collection of filters.
Notice that providing an empty filter object is an error.

```ts
export type Filter = {
  header?: HeaderFilter;
  transactions?: TransactionFilter[];
  events?: EventFilter[];
  messages?: MessageToL1Filter[];
  storageDiffs?: StorageDiffFilter[];
  contractChanges?: ContractChangeFilter[];
  nonceUpdates?: NonceUpdateFilter[];
};
```

### Header

The `HeaderFilter` object controls when the block header is returned to the client.

```ts
export type HeaderFilter = "always" | "on_data" | "on_data_or_on_new_block";
```

The values have the following meaning:

- `always`: Always return the header, even if no other filter matches.
- `on_data`: Return the header only if any other filter matches. This is the default value.
- `on_data_or_on_new_block`: Return the header only if any other filter matches. If no other filter matches, return the header only if the block is a new block.

### Events

Events are the most common filter used by Apibara users. You can filter by smart contract or event selector.

```ts
export type EventFilter = {
  id?: number;
  address?: FieldElement;
  keys?: (FieldElement | null)[];
  strict?: boolean;
  transactionStatus?: "succeeded" | "reverted" | "all";
  includeTransaction?: boolean;
  includeReceipt?: boolean;
  includeMessages?: boolean;
  includeSiblings?: boolean;
};
```

**Properties**

- `address`: filter by contract address. If empty, matches any contract
  address.
- `keys`: filter by keys. Use `null` to match _any_ value. The server will
  filter based only the first four elements of the array.
- `strict`: return events whose keys length matches the filter. By default, the
  filter does a prefix match on the keys.
- `transactionStatus`: return events emitted by transactions with the provided
  status. Defaults to `succeeded`.
- `includeTransaction`: also return the transaction that emitted the event.
- `includeReceipt`: also return the receipt of the transaction that emitted the
  event.
- `includeMessages`: also return all messages to L1 sent by the transaction that
  emitted the event.
- `includeSiblings`: also return all other events emitted by the same transaction
  that emitted the matched event.

**Examples**

- All events from a specific smart contract.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [{ address: MY_CONTRACT }],
};
```

- Multiple events from the same smart contract.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [
    {
      address: MY_CONTRACT,
      keys: [getSelector("Approve")],
    },
    {
      address: MY_CONTRACT,
      keys: [getSelector("Transfer")],
    },
  ],
};
```

- Multiple events from different smart contracts.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [
    {
      address: CONTRACT_A,
      keys: [getSelector("Transfer")],
    },
    {
      address: CONTRACT_B,
      keys: [getSelector("Transfer")],
      includeReceipt: false,
    },
    {
      address: CONTRACT_C,
      keys: [getSelector("Transfer")],
    },
  ],
};
```

- All `Transfer` events, from any contract.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [
    {
      keys: [getSelector("Transfer")],
    },
  ],
};
```

- All "new type" `Transfer` events with indexed sender and destination addresses.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [
    {
      keys: [getSelector("Transfer"), null, null],
      strict: true,
    },
  ],
};
```

### Transactions

Transactions on Starknet can be of different type (invoke, declare contract, deploy contract or account, handle L1 message). Clients can request all transactions or filter by transaction type.

```ts
export type InvokeTransactionV0Filter = {
  _tag: "invokeV0";
  invokeV0: {};
};

export type InvokeTransactionV1Filter = {
  _tag: "invokeV1";
  invokeV1: {};
};

export type InvokeTransactionV3Filter = {
  _tag: "invokeV3";
  invokeV3: {};
};

# Starknet data reference

This page contains reference about the available data in Starknet DNA streams.

### Related pages

- [Starknet data filter reference](/docs/networks/starknet/filter)

## Filter ID

All filters have an associated ID. To help clients correlate filters with data,
the filter ID is included in the `filterIds` field of all data objects.
This field contains the list of _all filter IDs_ that matched a piece of data.

## Nullable fields

**Important**: most fields are nullable to allow evolving the protocol. You should
always assert the presence of a field for critical indexers.

## Field elements

Apibara represents Starknet field elements as hex-encode strings.

```ts
export type FieldElement = `0x${string}`;
```

## Data types

### Block

The root object is the `Block`.

```ts
export type Block = {
  header?: BlockHeader;
  transactions: Transaction[];
  receipts: TransactionReceipt[];
  events: Event[];
  messages: MessageToL1[];
  storageDiffs: StorageDiff[];
  contractChanges: ContractChange[];
  nonceUpdates: NonceUpdate[];
};
```

### Block header

This is the block header, which contains information about the block.

```ts
export type BlockHeader = {
  blockHash?: FieldElement;
  parentBlockHash?: FieldElement;
  blockNumber?: bigint;
  sequencerAddress?: FieldElement;
  newRoot?: FieldElement;
  timestamp?: Date;
  starknetVersion?: string;
  l1GasPrice?: ResourcePrice;
  l1DataGasPrice?: ResourcePrice;

# Starknet event decoder

The Starknet SDK provides a `decodeEvent` function to help you decode Starknet events.

## Installation

Make sure you have the most recent Apibara Starknet package installed:

```bash
pnpm add @apibara/starknet@next
```

## Setup

To use the `decodeEvent` you need to define your contract ABI. We use `as const satisfies Abi` to ensure type safety and correctness. If you get a compile time error, it means that the ABI is not valid.

```typescript
import type { Abi } from "@apibara/starknet";

export const myAbi = [
  {
    kind: "enum",
    name: "myapp::core::Core::Event",
    type: "event",
    variants: [
      {
        kind: "flat",
        name: "UpgradeableEvent",
        type: "myapp::components::upgradeable::Upgradeable::Event",
      },
      {
        kind: "nested",
        name: "OwnedEvent",
        type: "myapp::components::owned::Owned::Event",
      },
    ],
  },
  /* ... a lot more events and types here ... */
] as const satisfies Abi;
```

## Usage

Once you have the ABI defined, you can decode events received from the Starknet stream.
Notice that if you setup your editor correctly, the value of `eventName` will be autocompleted with the available events.

```typescript
import { defineIndexer } from "apibara/indexer";
import { useLogger } from "apibara/plugins";

import { StarknetStream, decodeEvent } from "@apibara/starknet";

import { myAbi } from "./abi";

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
    async transform({ block }) {
      const { events } = block;
      for (const event of events) {
        const decoded = decodeEvent({
          abi: myAbi,
          event,
          eventName: "myapp::core::Core::Event",
          strict: false,
        });
      }
    },
  });
```

### Enum events

In most cases, you want to decode the "root" application event. This event is an enum that contains all the event types emitted by the contract.
The SDK supports this type of event and uses the special `_tag` field to identify which variant of the enum was emitted. The event's data is stored in a property with the name of the variant.

For example, let's consider the following Cairo code.

```rust
#[event]
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
pub enum Event {
    BookAdded: BookAdded,
    BookRemoved: BookRemoved,
}

#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
pub struct BookAdded {
    pub id: u32,
    pub title: felt252,
    #[key]
    pub author: felt252,
}

#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
pub struct BookRemoved {
    pub id: u32,
}
```

The Apibara SDK automatically infers the following event type (without code generation).

```typescript
type BookAdded = { id: number, title: FieldElement, author: FieldElement };
type BookRemoved = { id: number };
type Event =
  { _tag: "BookAdded", BookAdded: BookAdded }
  | { _tag: "BookRemoved", BookRemoved: BookRemoved };
```

This type works very well with the Typescript `switch` statement.

```typescript
const { args } = decodeEvent({ strict: true, /* ... */});

switch (args._tag) {
  case "BookAdded":
    // Notice that `args.BookAdded` is inferred not null.
    console.log(`Book added: ${args.BookAdded.id} ${args.BookAdded.title} ${args.BookAdded.author}`);
    break;
  case "BookRemoved":
    console.log(`Book removed: ${args.BookRemoved.id}`);
    break;
}
````

## Reference

### decodeEvent

**Parameters**

 - `abi`: the ABI of the contract.
 - `event`: the event to decode.
 - `eventName`: the name of the event to decode, as defined in the ABI.
 - `strict`: if `true`, the decoder will throw an error if the event is not found in the ABI. If `false`, the decoder will return `null` if the event is not found.

**Returns**

 - `args`: the decoded data of the event. The shape of the object depends on the event type.
 - `eventName`: the name of the event that was decoded.
 - `address`: the address of the contract that emitted the event.
 - `data`: the raw event data.
 - `keys`: the raw keys of the event.
 - `filterIds`: the IDs of the filters that matched the event.

# Starknet helpers reference

The `@apibara/starknet` package provides helper functions to work with Starknet data.

## Selector

Selectors are used to identify events and function calls.

### `getSelector`

This function returns the selector of a function or event given its name. The return value is a `0x${string}` value.

```ts
import { getSelector } from "@apibara/starknet";

const selector = getSelector("Approve");
```

### `getBigIntSelector`

This function returns the selector of a function or event given its name. The return value is a `BigInt`.

```ts
import { getBigIntSelector } from "@apibara/starknet";

const selector = getBigIntSelector("Approve");
```

## Data access

The SDK provides helper functions to access data from the block. Since data (transactions and receipts) are sorted by their index in the block, these helpers implement binary search to find them quickly.

### `getTransaction`

This function returns a transaction by its index in the block, if any.

```ts
import { getTransaction } from "@apibara/starknet";

// Accept `{ transactions: readonly Transaction[] }`.
const transaction = getTransaction(event.transactionIndex, block);

// Accept `readonly Transaction[]`.
const transaction = getTransaction(event.transactionIndex, block.transactions);
```

### `getReceipt`

This function returns a receipt by its index in the block, if any.

```ts
import { getReceipt } from "@apibara/starknet";

// Accept `{ receipts: readonly Receipt[] }`.
const receipt = getReceipt(event.receiptIndex, block);

// Accept `readonly Receipt[]`.
const receipt = getReceipt(event.receiptIndex, block.receipts);
```

# Upgrading from v1

This page contains a list of changes between DNA v1 and DNA v2.

## @apibara/starknet package

This package now works in combination with `@apibara/protocol` to provide a DNA stream
that automatically encodes and decodes the Protobuf data. This means tha field elements
are automatically converted to `0x${string}` values.

Notice that the data stream is now unary.

```js
import { createClient } from "@apibara/protocol";
import { Filter, StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";

const client = createClient(StarknetStream, process.env.STREAM_URL);

const filter = {
  events: [{
    address:
      "0x049d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7",
  }],
} satisfies Filter;

const request = StarknetStream.Request.make({
  filter: [filter],
  finality: "accepted",
  startingCursor: {
    orderKey: 800_000n,
  },
});

for await (const message of client.streamData(request)) {
  switch (message._tag) {
    case "data": {
      break;
    }
    case "invalidate": {
      break;
    }
    default: {
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

### Reconnecting on error

**NOTE:** this section only applies if you're using the gRPC client directly.

The client now doesn't automatically reconnect on error. This is because the reconnection step
is very delicate and depends on your indexer's implementation.
The recommended approach is to wrap your indexer's main loop in a `try/catch` block.

```ts
import { createClient, type ClientError, type Status } from "@apibara/protocol";
import { Filter, StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";

const client = createClient(StarknetStream, process.env.STREAM_URL);

const filter = {
  events: [
    {
      address:
        "0x049d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7",
    },
  ],
} satisfies Filter;

while (true) {
  try {
    const startingCursor = await loadCursorFromDatabase();
    const request = StarknetStream.Request.make({
      filter: [filter],
      finality: "accepted",
      startingCursor,
    });

    for await (const message of client.streamData(request)) {
    }
  } catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof ClientError) {
      // It's a gRPC error.
      if (err.status !== Status.INTERNAL) {
        // NON-INTERNAL errors are not recoverable.
        throw err;
      }

      // INTERNAL errors are caused by a disconnection.
      // Sleep and reconnect.
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 2_000));
    }
  }
}
```

## Filter

### Header

- The `header` field is now an enum. See the [dedicated section](/docs/networks/starknet/filter#header)
  in the filter documentation for more information.

### Events

- `fromAddress` is now `address`.
- The `keys` field accepts `null` values to match any key at that position.
- The `data` field was removed.
- Use `transactionStatus: "all"` instead of `includeReverted` to include reverted transactions.
- `includeReceipt` and `includeTransaction` are now `false` by default.

### Transactions

- Now you can only filter by transaction type.
- We will add transaction-specific filters in the future.
- Use `transactionStatus: "all"` instead of `includeReverted` to include reverted transactions.
- `includeReceipt` is now `false` by default.

### Messages

- Can now filter by `fromAddress` and `toAddress`.
- Use `transactionStatus: "all"` instead of `includeReverted` to include reverted transactions.
- `includeReceipt` and `includeTransaction` are now `false` by default.

### State Update

- State update has been split into separate filters for storage diffs, contract
  changes, and nonce updates.
- Declared and deployed contracts, declared classes, and replaced classes are now
  a single `contractChanges` filter.

## Block data

- Block data has been _"flattened"_. Use the `*Index` field to access related data.
  For example, the following code iterates over all events and looks up their
  transactions.

```js
for (const event of block.events) {
  const transaction = block.transactions.find(
    (tx) => tx.transactionIndex === event.transactionIndex
  );
}
```

### Events

- `fromAddress` is now `address`.
- `index` is now `eventIndex`.
- Events now include `transactionIndex`, `transactionHash`, and `transactionStatus`.

### Transactions

- `TransactionMeta` now includes `transactionIndex`, `transactionHash`, and `transactionStatus`.
- The transaction type is now an enum using the `_tag` field as discriminator.
- For other minor changes, see the [transaction documentation](/docs/networks/starknet/data#transaction).

### Receipts

- Transaction receipts are now transaction-specific.
- For other minor changes, see the [receipts documentation](/docs/networks/starknet/data#transaction-receipt).

### Messages

- `index` is now `messageIndex`.
- Messages now include `transactionIndex`, `transactionHash`, and `transactionStatus`.

# DNA v2 architecture

This page describes in detail the architecture of DNA v2.

At a high-level, the goals for DNA v2 are:

- serve onchain data through a protocol that's optimized for building indexers.
- provide a scalable and cost-efficient way to access onchain data.
- decouple compute from storage.

This is achieved by building a _cloud native_ service that ingests onchain data
from an archive node and stores it into Object Storage (for example Amazon S3,
Cloudflare R2). Data is served by stateless workers that read and filter data
from Object Storage before sending it to the indexers. The diagram below shows
all the high-level components that make a production deployment of DNA v2.
Communication between components is done through etcd.

## DNA service

The DNA service is comprised of several components:

- ingestion service: listens for new blocks on the network and stores them into
  Object Storage.
- compaction service: combines multiple blocks together into _segments_.
  Segments are grouped by data type (like logs, transactions, and receipts).
- pruner service: removes blocks that have been compacted to reduce storage cost.
- stream service: receives streaming requests from clients (indexers) and serves
  onchain data by filtering objects stored on S3.

### Ingestion service

The ingestion service fetches blocks from the network and stores them into
Object Storage. This service is the only chain-specific service in DNA, all
other components work on generic data-structures.

Serving onchain data requires serving a high-volume of data filtered by a
relatively small number of columns. When designing DNA, we took a few decisions
to make this process as efficient as possible:

- data is stored as pre-serialized protobuf messages to avoid wasting CPU
  cycles serializing the same data over and over again.
- filtering is entirely done using indices to reduce reads.
- joins (for example include logs' transactions) are also achieved with indices.

The ingestion service is responsible for creating this data and indices.
Data is grouped into _blocks_. Blocks are comprised of _fragments_, that
is groups of related data. All fragments have an unique numerical id used
to identify them. There are four different types of fragments:

- index: a collection of indices, the fragment id is `0`.
  Indices are grouped by the fragment they index.
- join: a collection of join indices, the fragment id is `254`.
  Join indices are also grouped by the source fragment index.
- header: the block header, the fragment id is `1`. Header are stored as
  pre-serialized protobuf messages.
- body: the chain-specific block data, grouped by fragment id.

Note that we call block number + hash a _cursor_ since it uniquely identifies a
block in the chain.

```

On supported networks, the ingestion service is also responsible for
periodically refreshing the mempool (pending) block data and uploading it into
Object Storage. This works exactly as for all other blocks.

The ingestion service tracks the canonical chain and uploads it to Object Storage.
This data is used by the stream service to track online and offline chain
reorganizations.

The ingestion service stores its data on etcd. Stream services subscribe to
etcd updates to receive notifications about new blocks ingested and other
changes to the chain (for example changes to the finalized block).

Finally, the ingestion service is _fault tolerant_. When the ingestion service
starts, it acquires a distributed lock from etcd to ensure only one instance is
running at the same time. If running multiple deployments of DNA, all other
instances will wait for the lock to be released (following a service restart or
crash) and will try to take over the ingestion.

### Compaction service

The compaction service groups together data from several blocks (usually 100 or
1000) into _segments_. Segments only contain data for one fragment type (for example 
headers, indices, and transactions).
In other words, the compaction service groups `N` blocks into `M` segments.

Only data that has been finalized is compacted into segments.

The compaction service also creates block-level indices called _groups_. Groups
combine indices from multiple blocks/segments to quickly look up which blocks
contain specific data. This type of index is very useful to increase performance
on sparse datasets.

### Pruner service

The pruner service cleans up block data that has been included in segments.
This is done to reduce the storage used by DNA.

### Object hierarchy

We now have all elements to understand the objects uploaded to Object Storage by the
ingestion service.
If you run DNA pointing it to your bucket, you can eventually see a folder structure
that looks like the following.

```txt

```

### Stream service

The stream service is responsible for serving data to clients. The raw onchain
data stored in Object Storage is filtered by the stream service before being
sent over the network, this results in lower egress fees compared to solutions
that filter data on the client.

Upon receiving a stream request, the service validates and compiles the request
into a _query_. A query is simply a list of index lookup requests that are
applied to each block.

The stream service loops then keeps repeating the following steps:

- check if it should send a new block of data or inform the client of a chain
  reorganization.
- load the indices from the segment or the block and use them to compute what
  data to send the client.
- load the pre-serialized protobuf messages and copy them to the output stream.

One critical aspect of the stream service is how it loads blocks and segments.
Reading from Object Storage has virtually unlimited throughput, but also high
latency. The service is also very likely to access data closer to the chain's
tip more frequently, and we should cache Object Storage requests to avoid
unnecessarily increase our cloud spending.

We achieve all of this (and more!) by using an hybrid cache that stores
frequently accessed data in memory and _on disk_. This may come as a surprise
since isn't the point of DNA to avoid expensive disks and rely on cheap Object
Storage? The reasons this design still makes sense are multiple:

- we can use cheaper and higher performance temporary NVMe disks attached
  directly to our server.
- we can quickly scale horizontally the stream service without re-indexing all
  data.
- we can use disks that are much smaller than the full chain's data. The cache
  dynamically stores the most frequently accessed data. Unused or rarely used
  data lives on Object Storage.

The following table, inspired [by the table in this article by
Vantage](https://www.vantage.sh/blog/ebs-vs-nvme-pricing-performance), shows the
difference in performance and price between an AWS EC2 instance using
(temporary) NVMe disks and two using EBS (one with a general purpose `gp3`
volume, and one with higher performance `io1` volume). All prices as of April
2024, US East, 1 year reserved with no upfront payment.

| Metric                | EBS (gp3)   | EBS (io1)   | NVMe              |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Instance Type         | r6i.8xlarge | r6i.8xlarge | i4i.8xlarge       |
| vCPU                  | 32          | 32          | 32                |
| Memory (GiB)          | 256         | 256         | 245               |
| Network (Gibps)       | 12.50       | 12.50       | 18.75             |
| Storage (GiB)         | 7500        | 7500        | 2x3750            |
| IOPS (read/write)     | 16,000      | 40,000      | 800,000 / 440,000 |
| Cost - Compute ($/mo) | 973         | 973         | 1,300             |
| Cost - Storage ($/mo) | 665         | 3,537       | 0                 |
| Cost - Total ($/mo)   | 1,638       | 4,510       | 1,300             |

Notice how the NVMe instance has 30-50x the IOPS per dollar. This price
difference means that Apibara users benefit from lower costs and/or higher
performance.

# DNA wire protocol

## `Cursor` message

Before explaining the DNA protocol in more detail, we're going to discuss the
`Cursor` message type. This type is used by all methods discussed later and
plays a central role in how DNA works.

DNA models a blockchain as a sequence of blocks. The distance of a block from
the first block in the chain (the genesis block) is known as chain height. The
genesis block has height `0`. Ideally, a blockchain should always build a block
on top of the most recent block, but that's not always the case. For this
reason, a block's height isn't enough to uniquely identify a block in the
blockchain. A _chain reorganization_ is when a chain produces blocks that are
not building on top of the most recent block. As we will see later, the DNA
protocol detects and handles chain reorganizations.
A block that can't be part of a chain reorganization is _finalized_.

DNA uses a _cursor_ to uniquely identify blocks on the chain. A cursor contains
two fields:

 - `order_key`: the block's height.
 - `unique_key`: the block's unique identifier. Depending on the chain, it's
   the block hash or state root.


## `Status` method

The `Status` method is used to retrieve the state of the DNA server. The request
is an empty message. The response has the following fields:

 - `last_ingested`: returns the last block ingested by the server. This is the most
    recent block available for streaming.
 - `finalized`: the most recent finalized block.
 - `starting`: the first available block. Usually this is the genesis block,
   but DNA server operators can prune older nodes to save on storage space.

## `StreamData` method

The `StreamData` method is used to start a DNA stream. It accepts a `StreamDataRequest`
message and returns an infinite stream of `StreamDataResponse` messages.

### Request

The request message is used to configure the stream. All fields except `filter`
are optional.

 - `starting_cursor`: resume the stream from the provided cursor. The first
   block received in the stream will be the block following the provided
   cursor. If no cursor is provided, the stream will start from the genesis
   block. Notice that since `starting_cursor` is a cursor, the DNA server can
   detect if that block has been part of a chain's reorganization while the
   indexer was offline.
 - `finality`: the stream contains data with at least the specified finality.
   Possible values are _finalized_ (only receive finalized data), _accepted_
   (receive finalized and non-finalized blocks), and _pending_ (receive
   finalized, non-finalized, and pending blocks).
 - `filter`: a non-empty list of chain-specific data filters.
 - `heartbeat_interval`: the stream will send an heartbeat message if there are
   no messages for the specified amount of time. This is useful to detect if
   the stream hangs. Value must be between 10 and 60 seconds.

### Response

Once the server validates and accepts the request, it starts streaming data.
Each stream message can be one of the following message types:

 - `data`: receive data about a block.
 - `invalidate`: the specified blocks don't belong to the canonical chain
   anymore because they were part of a chain reorganization.
 - `finalize`: the most recent finalized block moved forward.
 - `heartbeat`: an heartbeat message.
 - `system_message`: used to send messages from the server to the client.

#### `Data` message

Contains the requested data for a single block. All data messages cursors are
monotonically increasing, unless an `Invalidate` message is received.

The message contains the following fields:

 - `cursor`: the cursor of the block before this message. If the client
   reconnects using this cursor, the first message will be the same as this
   message.
 - `end_cursor`: this block's cursor. Reconnecting to the stream using this
   cursor will resume the stream.
 - `finality`: finality status of this block.
 - `production`: how the block was produced. Either `backfill` or `live`.
 - `data`: a list of encoded block data.

Notice how the `data` field is a _list of block data_. This sounds
counter-intuitive since the `Data` message contains data about a _single
block_. The reason is that, as we've seen in the _"Request"_ section,
the client can specify a list of filters. The `data` field has the same
length as the request's `filters` field.
In most cases, the client specifies a single filter and receives a single block
of data. For advanced use cases (like tracking contracts deployed by a
factory), the client uses multiple filters to have parallel streams of data
synced on the block number.

#### `Invalidate` message

This message warns the client about a chain reorganization. It contains the
following fields:

 - `cursor`: the new chain's head. All previously received messages where the
   `end_cursor.order_key` was greater than (`>`) this message
   `cursor.order_key` should be considered invalid/recalled.
 - `removed`: a list of cursors that used to belong to the canonical chain.

#### `Finalize` message

This message contains a single `cursor` field with the cursor of the most
recent finalized block. All data at or before this block can't be part of a
chain reorganization.

This message is useful to prune old data.

#### `Heartbeat` message

This message is sent at regular intervals once the stream reaches the chain's head.

Clients can detect if the stream hang by adding a timeout to the stream's _receive_
method.

#### `SytemMessage` message

This message is used by the server to send out-of-band messages to the client.
It contains text messages such as data usage, warnings about reaching the free
quota, or information about upcoming system upgrades.

## protobuf definition

This section contains the protobuf definition used by the DNA server and clients.
If you're implementing a new SDK for DNA, you can use this as the starting point.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package dna.v2.stream;

import "google/protobuf/duration.proto";

service DnaStream {
  // Stream data from the server.
  rpc StreamData(StreamDataRequest) returns (stream StreamDataResponse);
  // Get DNA server status.
  rpc Status(StatusRequest) returns (StatusResponse);
}

// A cursor over the stream content.
message Cursor {
  // Key used for ordering messages in the stream.
  //
  // This is usually the block or slot number.
  uint64 order_key = 1;
  // Key used to discriminate branches in the stream.
  //
  // This is usually the hash of the block.
  bytes unique_key = 2;
}

// Request for the `Status` method.
message StatusRequest {}

// Response for the `Status` method.
message StatusResponse {
  // The current head of the chain.
  Cursor current_head = 1;
  // The last cursor that was ingested by the node.
  Cursor last_ingested = 2;
  // The finalized block.
  Cursor finalized = 3;
  // The first block available.
  Cursor starting = 4;
}

// Request data to be streamed.
message StreamDataRequest {
  // Cursor to start streaming from.
  //
  // If not specified, starts from the genesis block.
  // Use the data's message `end_cursor` field to resume streaming.
  optional Cursor starting_cursor = 1;
  // Return data with the specified finality.
  //
  // If not specified, defaults to `DATA_FINALITY_ACCEPTED`.
  optional DataFinality finality = 2;
  // Filters used to generate data.
  repeated bytes filter = 3;
  // Heartbeat interval.
  //
  // Value must be between 10 and 60 seconds.
  // If not specified, defaults to 30 seconds.
  optional google.protobuf.Duration heartbeat_interval = 4;
}

// Contains a piece of streamed data.
message StreamDataResponse {
  oneof message {
    Data data = 1;
    Invalidate invalidate = 2;
    Finalize finalize = 3;
    Heartbeat heartbeat = 4;
    SystemMessage system_message = 5;
  }
}

// Invalidate data after the given cursor.
message Invalidate {
  // The cursor of the new chain's head.
  //
  // All data after this cursor should be considered invalid.
  Cursor cursor = 1;
  // List of blocks that were removed from the chain.
  repeated Cursor removed = 2;
}

// Move the finalized block forward.
message Finalize {
  // The cursor of the new finalized block.
  //
  // All data before this cursor cannot be invalidated.
  Cursor cursor = 1;
}

// A single block of data.
//
// If the request specified multiple filters, the `data` field will contain the
// data for each filter in the same order as the filters were specified in the
// request.
// If no data is available for a filter, the corresponding data field will be
// empty.
message Data {
  // Cursor that generated this block of data.
  optional Cursor cursor = 1;
  // Block cursor. Use this cursor to resume the stream.
  Cursor end_cursor = 2;
  // The finality status of the block.
  DataFinality finality = 3;
  // The block data.
  //
  // This message contains chain-specific data serialized using protobuf.
  repeated bytes data = 4;
  // The production mode of the block.
  DataProduction production = 5;
}

// Sent to clients to check if stream is still connected.
message Heartbeat {}

// Message from the server to the client.
message SystemMessage {
  oneof output {
    // Output to stdout.
    string stdout = 1;
    // Output to stderr.
    string stderr = 2;
  }
}

// Data finality.
enum DataFinality {
  DATA_FINALITY_UNKNOWN = 0;
  // Data was received, but is not part of the canonical chain yet.
  DATA_FINALITY_PENDING = 1;
  // Data is now part of the canonical chain, but could still be invalidated.
  DATA_FINALITY_ACCEPTED = 2;
  // Data is finalized and cannot be invalidated.
  DATA_FINALITY_FINALIZED = 3;
}

// Data production mode.
enum DataProduction {
  DATA_PRODUCTION_UNKNOWN = 0;
  // Data is for a backfilled block.
  DATA_PRODUCTION_BACKFILL = 1;
  // Data is for a live block.
  DATA_PRODUCTION_LIVE = 2;
}
```

# Adding a new chain

This page explains how to add support for a new chain to the DNA protocol. It's recommended that you're familiar with the high-level [DNA architecture](/docs/dna/architecture) and the [DNA streaming protocol](/docs/dna/protocol) before reading this page.

## Overview

Adding a new chain is relatively straightforward. Most of the code you need to write is describing the type of data stored on your chain.
The guide is split in the following sections:

- **gRPC Protocol**: describes how to augment the gRPC protocol with filters and data types specific to the new chain.
- **Storage**: describes how data is stored on disk and S3.
- **Data filtering**: describes how to filter data based on the client's request.

## gRPC Protocol

The first step is to define the root `Filter` and `Block` protobuf messages.

There are a few hard requirements on the messages:

- The `header` field of the block must have tag `1`.
- All other fields can have any tag.
- Add one message type for each chain's resource (transactions, receipts, logs, etc.).
- Each resource must have a `filter_ids` field with tag `1`.
- Add a `Filter.id: uint32` property. Indexers use this to know which filters matched a specific piece of data and is used to populate the `filter_ids` field.

The following items are optional:

- Add an option to the `Filter` to request all block headers. Users use this to debug their indexer.
- Think how users are going to use the data. For example, developers often access the transaction's hash of a log, for this reason we include the transaction hash in the `Log` message.
- Avoid excessive nesting of messages.

## Storage

The goal of the ingestion service is to fetch data from the chain (using the chain's RPC protocol), preprocess and index it, and then store it into the object storage.

DNA stores block data as pre-serialized protobuf messages. This is done to send data to clients by
copying bytes directly, without expensive serialization and deserialization.

Since DNA doesn't know about the chain, it needs a way to filter data without scanning the entire block.
This is done with _indices_.

The chain-specific ingestion service is responsible for creating these indices. The next section goes into
detail how indices work, the important part is that:

- Indices are grouped by the type of data they index (for example transactions, logs, and traces).
- For each type of data, there can be multiple indices.
- Indices point to one or more pre-serialized protobuf messages.

## Data filtering

As mentioned in the previous section, the DNA server uses indices to lookup data without scanning the entire block.
This is done by compiling the protobuf filter sent by the client into a special representation.
This `Filter` specifies:

- What resource to filter (for example transactions, logs, and traces).
- The list of conditions to match.

A _condition_ is a tuple with the filter id and the lookup key.
